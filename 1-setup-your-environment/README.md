# Setting up your environment

This workshop is designed to help you modernize .NET applications. 

Everything from modernizing code from .NET Framework to a modern .NET, getting all that code ready for the cloud with microservices and .NET Aspire, and even adding in a sprinkling of AI.

But before we get to all that we need to install some tools.

## üìù Tooling and frameworks

For the rest of this workshop you're going to need some tooling and frameworks that you may or may not already have.

The workshop is broken up into 2 parts:

- Part 1: Modernizing .NET Framework code into modern .NET
- Part 2: Preparing for the cloud

We'll provide starter solutions for each part - so if you want to jump right into Part 2 on preparing for the cloud, you can skip installing all the stuff needed for Part 1.
