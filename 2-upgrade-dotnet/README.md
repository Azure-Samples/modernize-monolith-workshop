# 🔄 Upgrade .NET applications

Welcome to Chapter 2 of the upgrade workshop! This section focuses on upgrading your .NET Framework applications to modern .NET using different approaches and tools.

## 📋 What you'll learn

In this chapter, you'll explore two different approaches to upgrade your .NET applications:

🛠️ **Traditional Migration**: Using .NET Upgrade Assistant for structured, step-by-step migration  
🤖 **AI-Powered Upgrade**: Leveraging GitHub Copilot for intelligent, automated upgrade  

Both approaches accomplish the same goal - transforming your legacy .NET Framework application into a modern .NET application - but use different methodologies and tools.

## 🚀 Choose your path

Select the approach that best fits your learning style and requirements:

### Option A: .NET Upgrade Assistant (traditional approach)
**[🔄 Upgrade with .NET Upgrade Assistant](./2-upgrade-with-dotnet-upgrade-assistant/README.md)**

- Scans your project and gives a report to guide your upgrade.
- Lets you choose in-place, side-by-side, or incremental upgrade modes.
- Works with many project types like ASP.NET, Windows Forms, and more.

### Option B: What is GitHub Copilot app modernization (AI-powered approach)
**[🤖 Upgrade with GitHub Copilot](./2-upgrade-with-ghcp-modernization-app/README.md)**

- Analyzes your solution and creates a smart upgrade plan, handling dependencies in the right order.
- Automates code changes and upgrades, but asks for your help when needed and learns from your fixes.
- Runs your unit tests after upgrading to make sure everything works as expected.

## 🎯 Next steps

After completing either approach (or both!), you'll be ready to move on to:

**[🤖 Modernize with GitHub Copilot →](../3-modernize-with-github-copilot/README.md)**

**💡 Pro Tip**: Both approaches will give you hands-on experience with modernizing .NET code. Choose based on whether you want to focus on traditional tooling or explore AI-powered development workflows. You can always come back and try the other approach later!
