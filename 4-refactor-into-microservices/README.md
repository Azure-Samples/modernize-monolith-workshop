# 🏗️ Refactor into Microservices

Learn how to break down your monolithic application into focused, scalable microservices that can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.

## 📋 What You'll Do

This section covers:

🔨 Microservices architecture patterns  
📦 Service decomposition strategies  
🔗 Inter-service communication  
🎯 Defining service boundaries  

## 📚 Instructions

While the `eShopLite.StoreCore` app has been refactored and modernized, there are still room to upgrade the Blazor app itself. Currently, the `eShopLite.StoreCore` uses Blazor Server App structure. Let's modernize it to Blazor Web App, using GitHub Copilot.

### 🔍 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- GitHub Copilot installed and activated in Visual Studio
- Your migrated eShopLite.StoreCore project from the previous section
- Docker Desktop is up and running

### 🎯 Add MCP Servers

1. First, add some useful MCP servers for modernization. Add a JSON file, `.mcp.json` directly under the solution. Then add the following two MCP servers - [`Microsoft Learn Docs`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/support/mcp) and [`sequentialthinking`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking).

    ```jsonc
    // .mcp.json
    {
      "servers": {
        "microsoft.docs.mcp": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp"
        },
        "sequentialthinking": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "--rm",
            "-i",
            "mcp/sequentialthinking"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

   Once you add this `.mcp.json` file, you'll be able to see both MCP servers are in the `active` state.

   > **NOTE**: The images below show a **Context7** MCP server - we replaced that with Microsoft Docs and will update the reference images soon!

   > **NOTE**: Either MCP server might not be in the `active` state. In this case,  click the `restart` button to restart the MCP server.

### 📝 Modernize Blazor Server App to Blazor Web App

1. Add a new Blazor web app project to the solution. The new Blazor web app project is `eShopLite.Store`.
1. Make sure you've included both `context7` and `sequentialthinking` MCP servers as tools.

   > **NOTE**: It might not be appearing at the first time. In this case, close Visual Studio and reopen it. If this fails, create a new Copilot chat window.

1. Enter the following prompt for migration.

    ```text
    Here's the current Blazor app, `eShopLite.StoreCore`. I'd like to migrate this app to `eShopLite.Store`. Here are my instructions for you to follow:
    
    - Use `context7` and `sequentialthinking` MCP servers.
    - Migrate `eShopLite.StoreCore` to `eShopLite.Store`.
    - Keep the layout unchanged.
    - Keep the CSS style unchanged.
    - Keep the JS interaction unchanged.
    ```

1. GitHub Copilot starts the migration process. It might ask you to continue from time to time. You can manually handle it or allow to continue without asking.
1. GitHub Copilot sometimes stops progressing and wait for you to enter additional prompt. In that case, enter one of the following prompts until it completes the whole migration.

    ```text
    Keep continuing
    Continue
    Please go for it
    ```

1. Once the migration is complete, run the `eShopLite.Store` application to verify whether the layout is broken or not. If the layout is broken like the image below, add the screenshot to Visual Studio as additional context and enter the following prompt to rectify it.

   ![Broken layout](./images/refactor-into-microservices-03.png)

    ```text
    When I run the app, the layout is completely broken. Find the issue and fix it.
    ```

   If there are other layout issues found, iterate it. Here's an example:

   ![Product images missing](./images/refactor-into-microservices-04.png)

    ```text
    All the product images are missing. Find the issue and fix it.
    ```

1. Once all the fix is complete run the `eShopLite.Store` app and verify everything works as expected.

   > **Pro Tips**: It would be great if you click the "Keep" button after each turn GitHub Copilot completes steps, so that you can easily track changes between turns.

1. Modernization to Blazor Web App has now been complete.

Althouth the `eShopLite.Store` app has been modernized, it is still monolith. For the app to be more cloud-native, let's divide the `eShopLite.Store` app into three &ndash; the existing `eShopLite.Store` still takes care of the UI frontend part, but the product data and store location data are running as separate API apps. GitHub Copilot makes this monolith app into microservice apps way easier.

### ✂️ Separate `eShopLite.Products` and `eShopLite.StoreInfo` from `eShopLite.Store`

1. In a new GitHub Copilot Chat, make sure it's the agent mode.
1. Make sure both `context7` and `sequentialthinking` MCP servers are up and running, and included as tools.
1. Add two ASP.NET Core Web API projects called `eShopLite.Products` and `eShopLite.StoreInfo`.
1. Enter the following prompt to covert microservices.

    ```text
    Here's the Blazor monolith app, `eShopLite.Store`. I'd like to covert it into microservices by separating the product API to `eShopLite.Products` and store info API to `eShopLite.StoreInfo`. The main UI logic should remain at `eShopLite.Store`. Here are my instructions for you to follow:
    
    - Use `context7` and `sequentialthinking` MCP servers.
    - Extract the product API to `eShopLite.Products` from `eShopLite.Store`.
    - Extract the store info API to `eShopLite.StoreInfo` from `eShopLite.Store`.
    - The existing database structure should also be separated - `ProductDbContext` and `StoreInfoDbContext`.
    - Both API apps should keep using SQLite.
    - Both API apps should follow the Minimal API approach instead of Controllers/Actions.
    - The `eShopLite.Store` app should communicate with both APIs through the `ApiClient` class like `ProductApiClient` or `StoreInfoApiClient` inheriting the base `ApiClient` class.
    - DO NOT ADD new features
    - DO NOT ALT existing features
    ```

1. Once the separation to microservices is complete, build the entire solution, run all the apps and verify whether everything works well or not.

> 🪧**IMPORTANT**
>
> You may need to import the Projects it generates into your solution.
>
> You can do this by right-clicking on the solution in Solution Explorer and selecting "Add" > "Existing Project..." to locate and add the new projects.

### ⛓️‍💥 Delete `eShopLite.StoreCore`

`eShopLite.StoreCore` has now been modernized to `eShopLite.Store`, followed by being split into three microservices &ndash; `eShopLite.Store` for UI frontend, `eShopLite.Products` for product API and `eShopLite.StoreInfo` for store info API.

Therefore, we don't need `eShopLite.StoreCore` any longer. Remove it from the solution.

Done! Your `eShopLite` app is now fully working in the microservice architecture!
